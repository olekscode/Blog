# Best Resources to Study Machine Learning

I am doing a machine learning PhD in a research group that works mostly with software engineering. I often interact with developer who want to learn about machine learning because it is a hot field.

In this article, I summarize the list of what I find to be the best resources to study machine learning. This list is intended for people who are already good at programming and understand the general concepts of computer science but don't necessarily have a strong mathematical background.

## Curriculum

First, I try to summarize the main topics that you need to cover. It can be tempting to jump straight into deep learning and start generating deep dream videos or teaching an AlphaGo to play games. However, to really unbderstand what's going on in those systems, you need to start with the basic concepts.

You can learn about each topic separately by searching them on Google. Or you can take a more systematic approach and read a book or follow an online course. The important thing is that you should be familiar with those topics and have a general understanding of the main concepts.

1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Linear Regression
4. Classification
5. Neural Networks
6. Natural Language Processing
7. Data Mining
8. Deep Learning
9. Computer Vision

## How much math do I need?

That depends on your goals. Machine learning is just a tool that can be approached from multiple perspectives: probabilistic, optimizational, algorithmic, information-theory, etc. How deep should you understand those topics depends on how you are planning to use them.

People often say that you can not become an expert in ML if you are not good in math. Generally speaking, I agree with that statement. But what if you don't have time to learn linar algebra and bayessian statistics. Does it mean that you can not use macine learning? Not really... you can still 

### I want to become a data scientist or a full-time machine learning expert

Learn algebra, probability, statistics, etc.

### I want to use machine learning in my research or programming projects

Understand the basic concepts in math, but don't dive too deep into the probability.
